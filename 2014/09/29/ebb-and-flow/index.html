<p>I’ve been looking back at this phase, as it’s going to end on Friday, to see how many points the team tends to clear in a sprint:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sprint 1 — 54.5 cleared / 7 not completed</li>
<li>Sprint 2 — 23 cleared / 27.5 not completed</li>
<li>Sprint 3 — 52 completed / 14 not completed</li>
<li>Sprint 4 — 30 completed so far / 32 not completed so far</li>
</ul>


<p>Our second sprint was a bit of an anomaly because we were in the middle of some server migrations without any adequate infrastructure support, so we spent most of the sprint fighting those fires. Of the 27.5 points not completed, a number were in progress or review, which definitely bolstered the next sprint’s output back to the levels of the first sprint. Most of the tickets that don’t get completed tend to be assigned to the infrastructure team, who seem to be struggling at the moment. This current, final sprint, though, is shaping up to beat them all. Only a week in and all of the tickets were either in progress or in review, and engineers were happily rooting around in the backlog for things to work on.</p>

<p>I’ve not been overly prescriptive here, which is perhaps a mistake, but they seem to be focussing on reliability and technical debt tickets, which I think is a <a href="http://remotepdm.github.io/diary/2014/09/17/phase-8/">good</a> <a href="http://remotepdm.github.io/diary/2014-09-24-phase-planning-vs-technical-debt/">thing</a>. If anything it means there’ll be less of it to do in the upcoming phase, so I can sneak in some more projects, and will improve morale so we end the phase on a high, so I’m not too worried about it.</p>

<p>We are looking like we’re going to clear 20% more points than we normally do, though, which makes it tricky to plan phases and sprints when you don’t really have a good sense of the fluctuations in people’s work. All the more reason to have the next sprint or two fairly planned out and the backlog prioritised, though, keeps me on my toes.</p>

<p>My own energy flow is something I need to keep an eye on as well. After my boss could find no fault in my new phase document, and there was some other smaller successes last week, Monday was always going to have a lot to live up to. I do find I have strong days where I <em>feel</em> busy and productive, maybe because I’ve had some good conversations, or I’ve got some good feedback. It’s the days where my energy is low that I need to watch out for, as it usually coincides with something hard or nebulous that I’m trying to work on, or something that I don’t quite have a good handle on and I find it hard to get going. These are the days that I need to be more disciplined on. I’ve recently found that setting my phone to chime every 45 minutes gives me manageable chunks of time during which I’m actually able to focus very easily. I turn off HipChat notifications and bury myself in iA Writer or Google Docs. This seems to be the only way to break the back of these difficult and diffuse tasks, hard problems that require someone to sit down and work through. They’re probably the places where I’m going to do the most good.</p>
