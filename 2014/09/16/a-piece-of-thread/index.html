<p>Not a massively productive day yesterday, spent most of it trying to tease out all the ramifications of a particular request, and probably annoying an engineer by not understanding something.</p>

<p>Brought up a few things for me, though. The first is that problems and requests are rarely as simple as they appear at first blush, and it&rsquo;s my job to ask the right questions to get at a better understanding of an issue&rsquo;s complexity before I get anywhere near asking an engineer about it. It&rsquo;s not quite like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">the 5 whys technique</a>, at least not for me, because you often can&rsquo;t ask all the necessary questions in a single meeting with someone, you need to go and ruminate on it for a little while, work out what the edge cases might be and what problems they throw up, then go back to that original person.</p>

<p>Second, when working with engineers you really can be speaking a completely different language at times and this can get incredibly frustrating, for both sides. It&rsquo;s understandable, if you&rsquo;ve been working with certain systems for a long time it&rsquo;s not necessarily very easy to put yourself in the position of someone who knows nothing about those systems. I tried the usual things like rephrasing my questions, testing out different (what I believed to be) synonyms to see if they elicited differing responses, but nothing seemed to be working. Part of this was definitely my fault as I persisted in using chat to conduct the conversation when I should have immediately jumped into a video call, especially when I know the engineer in question can come across completely differently in chat and on video.</p>

<p>Partly it&rsquo;s my ignorance of the technology, though. I&rsquo;m not the most technical of product managers; I don&rsquo;t have a CS degree and my speciality lies more in front-end work than the systems architecture that I&rsquo;m managing, so it will take me a while to get my head around it, but it was definitely a frustrating day.</p>
