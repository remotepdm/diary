        <h3>17 Sep 2014</h3>
<p>I know, I know, I should already have this and the next phase locked down in my mind, and I definitely shouldn&rsquo;t be planning it with only one sprint left in the current phase &ndash; I&rsquo;ll do better, I promise.</p>

<p>So I tried to get the key project features and requirements set up on a <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a> board, which seemed  well suited to my four levels of priority: perennial, short-, mid- and long-term. The problem I have with Trello, though, is that it hides the card descriptions behind a little icon, and I needed more to be able to see more information at a glance in order to make my decisions.</p>

<p>Trusty paper to the rescue, I started looking at the tickets and requests through the company&rsquo;s stated goals for the next 100 days: growing the funnel; data mining to drive growth; and empowering the sales team. I started trying to put the larger chunks of work into these three buckets, which was certainly helpful to begin with, but obviously the company&rsquo;s objectives don&rsquo;t necessarily equate neatly with the work we need to do. Just because something isn&rsquo;t a short-term company objective doesn&rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&rsquo;t be doing it. I&rsquo;ve been told by one of the experienced product managers here that it&rsquo;s our job to guard the company against things it can&rsquo;t foresee, and I think that&rsquo;s good advice.</p>

<p>In addition to business objectives, then, I also had to think about &ldquo;icebergs&rdquo; &ndash; which is what I&rsquo;m calling things that have the potential to hurt us at some point. These can include things like <a href="http://remotepdm.github.io/diary/2014/09/16/technical-debt/">technical debt</a>, finance and accounting requests and unusual content types. Once I&rsquo;d addressed those I felt a lot more comfortable that I was addressing both sides of the coin, business objectives on the one side and icebergs on the other, and that I could plan a phase that would address the issues we face in the round, rather than purely pursuing the company goals. Maybe that&rsquo;s a mistake, but we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>The problem of prioritisation still remained, however. So I tried to approach is from a different angle, asking myself: &ldquo;If you could only do one thing in the next sprint, what would it be?&rdquo; This forced me to be completely ruthless about what was the most important thing for us at that moment in time. Then I expanded it to two things, then three and so on. This felt like another useful exercise, so I&rsquo;m going to let that settle overnight and see how I feel about it in the morning.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.adamnash.com/">Adam Nash</a> has some other useful ways of thinking about prioritisation in <a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-ways-to-prioritize-a-list-of-product-features">this excellent Quora discussion</a>, grouping each feature (enhancement) into four distinct buckets: metrics movers; customer requests; delight; and strategic. The final one, which he added after coming up with the first three, is encouraging for me; he says:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>There are times when you include features that meet the definition of none of the previous three buckets, but are included for strategic reasons. These reasons can include experimentation (e.g. how will users interact with or utilize this feature) or data (e.g. we need to start the user-generated content funnel now so that months from now we can build a higher level feature over it).</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This feels a but like a vindication of my &ldquo;iceberg&rdquo; approach, or at least for valuing features that don&rsquo;t immediately address business goals.</p>

<p>The discussion had some other interesting points that I&rsquo;m going to save here; the first was concerning how much confidence you should have in your future phase/sprint planning:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The next 3 months should have a confidence of ~90%, the next 3 ~65&ndash;75% and after that it goes down to like 40% confidence because your roadmap will evolve during that time.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll be able to stick to 90% for the next three months, but it&rsquo;s an interesting scale to keep in mind.</p>

<p>The other was the now-famous Amazon pre-product press release, which I&rsquo;d already read elsewhere:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>At the beginning of every new product (or new release of an existing product), write a press release for the finished product. This ensures you prioritize items that can really  sell to your customers once you roll out, and not waste your resources on obscure (yet expensive) improvements that will only impress the people who have built the product.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This struck me today because I was thinking about how best to communicate the decision making processes behind the prioritisation I was proposing, and I wondered if each big feature item in the phase document could have a mini press release justifying it. They could even include attempts at humour! Interesting to think about this approach on a small scale, will see how that goes.</p>
