        <h1>Diary of a remote<br/>product manager</h1>
        <h2><a class="divider" href="">/</a> Phase planning vs technical debt</h2>
        <h3>24 Sep 2014</h3>
<p>Midway through planning the next phase (which is hard enough a thing to do for the first time in itself) I’m informed that half of each sprint will need to be taken by a specific project in order to meet an end-of-year deadline. This is obviously a big blow to my plans, and invalidates all the work I’ve done on the phase planning up until now, which is a shame, but I have to make do. The next question is obviously, what can I do with half a phase?</p>

<p>Here we come to what I can only assume is an age-old (product) management question — the balance between new features and bug fixes. I have a bunch of new features that I was planning to introduce this phase, but I also have a large number of technical debt tickets pending. I came across an interesting discussion on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Product-Management/As-a-product-manager-how-do-you-prioritize-bug-fixes-vs-new-product-features">Quora</a> (seriously, Quora is great for these kinds of questions) that dealt precisely with this issue. Again, I found the same name at the top of the list —     Ian McAllister, General Manager at Amazon. He talks about how he constructs a framework for all of his decision making, and how he keeps two groups of tickets in mind: baselines and themes.</p>

<p>Themes are “the high-level areas you need to invest in to grow your business”, while baselines include</p>

<blockquote><p><em>expectations of quality, design, usability, performance or other defensive measures that might not rise to the top of your offensive themes, but nevertheless need to be maintained at some level</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is a very helpful grouping to keep in mind, and it addresses a concern I had in <a href="/2014/09/17/phase-8/">another post</a> recently, about how you balance your offensive and defensive objectives. I don’t know if I’m being swayed by overly noisy engineers, but I’m still leaning towards devoting a fair amount of what’s left of this phase to technical debt tickets, and it’s helped to have this idea of a “baseline”.</p>

<p>At the moment, it seems like the systems that my team is responsible for don’t really have any consistent baselines, or at least any baselines that are comparable with other systems in the business. We have inconsistent reporting across all of our servers, we don’t have a QA environment, we have a vast number of poorly monitored tasks running and so on. McAllister goes on his Quora reply to say:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>allocate a certain number of resources needed to meet (but not exceed) your baselines, and devote the rest to your themes</em></p></blockquote>

<p>The fact that we don’t really seem to <em>have</em> any baselines makes me think that we should probably devote some resources to setting them up. Maybe that’s me playing it safe, as is my natural instinct, but that’s what my gut tells me. There’s probably a case to be made for McAllister’s next point as well:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>If you don’t have enough resources left over after meeting your defensive baselines then you’re not staffed appropriately. You can either staff up or adjust your defensive baselines downwards.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>My team may very well be understaffed, and I think people in the rest of the business are starting to realise this as well. It’s getting embarrassing for a company of our size to have content ingestion systems that are this shonky.</p>

<p>There were a few other interesting tidbits in the article that I thought were also worth highlighting:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Bugs beget more bugs.</em></p>

<p><em>Bugs suck up resources in tech support and on the engineering team.</em></p>

<p><em>Making quality “negotiable” has a demoralizing effect on the engineering team.</em></p></blockquote>
