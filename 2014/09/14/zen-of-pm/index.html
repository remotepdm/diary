        <h3>14 Sep 2014</h3>
<p>Not everything in <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/zen-of-pm/">this article</a> is completely relevant to my role, but there were enough phrases that rang true for it to make sense to collect them here.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Framing is the art of identifying what is truly important and separating the “could” from the “should.”</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is really important, and something that can be difficult to keep in mind when there are requests flying from all directions, and when &ldquo;could&rdquo; can switch to &ldquo;should&rdquo; in as little as 24 hours! I need to make a list of the things that my team absolutely must do, then beneath that things that are likely to cause the business headaches in the foreseeable future, and then the &ldquo;could&rdquo; items.</p>

<p>I also think I need to apportion a certain amount of story points in each sprint for supporting initiatives elsewhere in the company, but also retain a sizeable amount for our own initiatives, because they can so easily get pushed back over and over in this mad rush to solve short-term business objectives that are entirely worthy but naturally don&rsquo;t take into account the more long-term objectives that I also have to bear in mind on a daily basis.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Who are the customers and what are their needs and priorities? What is happening in the marketplace? What are competitors doing and what are our options for responding and differentiating? How is technology changing and what possibilities does it offer our customers? What are the priorities for our business?</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is definitely something I&rsquo;ve not got a handle on yet, other than the simplistic priorities like &ldquo;get more traffic so we can get more users&rdquo;, or &ldquo;ingest more content&rdquo;. Perhaps it would be a good idea to carve some time every day to take a step back from the everyday concerns of the team and try to take in a broader view, look at competitors and so on. It&rsquo;s less easy to do this, though, if what you&rsquo;re working on isn&rsquo;t as immediately visible or comparable as something like a mobile application.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The purpose of a frame is to narrow the focus on a clear and compelling vision that fits within this landscape. This link between vision and landscape is critical. A vision without this context is fragile and fails to provide teams with the basis for making the myriad of day to day decisions they inevitably face. So, how does a program manager go about creating such a frame? The three key elements are gathering information, grokking the space, and getting the team up to speed.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Communicating the vision is difficult when you can&rsquo;t reliably get everyone in the same HipChat room on any given day, and Google docs can often get lost in people&rsquo;s inboxes, especially with the amount of error messages some of us are getting at the moment! Maybe I should make it a little bit at the beginning of our sprint planning meetings, just 5&ndash;10 minutes to go over any changes in the plan, or update people on shifting requirements.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>There is a wealth of information available to any program manager willing to make the effort to find it: customer studies and surveys, customer satisfaction indexes, personas, usability data, SQM/Watson data, online newsgroups, customer advisory boards, partner feedback, product support reports, industry analysis, competitive product reviews, focus group results, and more.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m at least partially addressing this one: I&rsquo;ve got Twitter searches set up; I&rsquo;m signed up to the Gmail group for our customer responses; I&rsquo;ve asked the support team to help me get a sense of how our customer support requests have been changing over time. Especially interested in seeing how many content complaints we get month-on-month. I&rsquo;m not 100% sold on the idea that people complain about the cosmetics of our content, I&rsquo;ll bet they complain more about the functionality. Of course, if one person complains it may mean an order of magnitude more people are displeased by it, but I think we should be cautious about assuming that our standards for our content are shared by our users.</p>

<p>Content providers are users of our services as well, though, and I don&rsquo;t get the sense that that&rsquo;s given much consideration sometimes, maybe for good reason. If our systems are rubbish, though, there&rsquo;s the possibility that a content provider would rather sign up with a competitor than use us.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>A word of caution: There is an unlimited amount of information out there, but it can be tough to find the answers you are looking for. Don’t get frustrated. Remember that you aren’t really looking for specific answers. You are looking to understand the space and gain context. What you learn may even lead to more questions and conflicting priorities. Gathering information is not like hunting for Easter eggs. If you think of this as a search for answers, you may find yourself on an endless quest. Gathering information is just a starting point—your work isn’t done here, so take what you learn and move forward.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Yes, it&rsquo;s as much about challenging your own assumptions and decisions as it is with trying to find the answer to a question. The job is never truly done, in the sense that there&rsquo;s always more to learn, or different questions to ask, but also in the sense that once you&rsquo;ve got some answers the <em>real</em> work begins when you start to <em>apply</em> those answers.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Your role isn’t handing out decisions, it’s empowering the team with the understanding and shared framework to make these decisions throughout the lifecycle of the product.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Not every team member will have had the time or the opportunity to come to the same conclusions that I have, so it&rsquo;s my job to communicate back my learning and see if people come to the same conclusions. It&rsquo;s not always easy to stop yourself from slipping into a &ldquo;this is my decision&rdquo; mindset, but equally there are times when people seem to be clamouring for a decision and you have to make one.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>establish your feature’s value proposition</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Every single thing that we decide to work on needs to have a value proposition for users and for the business. I&rsquo;ve started appending these to high priority JIRA tickets and into our sprint kick-off documents. The side effect of this is that people will naturally question why something is being done, even (and maybe especially) when I&rsquo;ve said that I think it should be.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>recall the framing, and ask whether the value proposition lines up with the value you actually want to deliver. Many features (and products) have failed, not because they didn’t deliver some value, but because they delivered the wrong value.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This feels like a hard thing to do, especially when you&rsquo;ve been pushing hard for a piece of work to be done and then something shifts and it&rsquo;s no longer as valuable as it was. I haven&rsquo;t yet come across a scenario where the value proposition I&rsquo;ve got for a piece of work isn&rsquo;t actually delivering what I think it should, but I have come across instances of a piece of work having a completely different value proposition to what I originally thought once I did a bit more digging.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Remember, your job is to lead the effort to get to a great solution … not to be the one with all the great ideas.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s an especially useful thing to bear in mind when you&rsquo;re dealing in an area where you don&rsquo;t have sufficient technical expertise to come up with solutions all the time. Important not to use a lack of technical expertise as a crutch, though.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>managing and driving effective iteration is the most important skill of all</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Something I definitely haven&rsquo;t mastered yet, but maybe the next phase will be my best opportunity to try this, as the current phase objectives weren&rsquo;t set by me. At the moment our sprints feel like they&rsquo;re pretty piecemeal and reactive, rather than iteratively working on something sprint after sprint. I&rsquo;m definitely not a motivation expert, but that would leave me a little at-sea if I were an engineer I&rsquo;d have thought. (Aside: I believe the etymology of the word &lsquo;engineer&rsquo; comes from those individuals who constructed and maintained early steam pumps, or &lsquo;engines&rsquo;, in 18th century England.)</p>

<blockquote><p><em>if a decision has to be made in order to keep the iterative design process moving forward, then you need to take a risk and make the call</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is going to be incredibly hard I think, especially with the nature of the requests that are coming in.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Program managers often take notes and schedule meetings, but not because everyone else’s time is more valuable, but because they realize the value in documenting decisions and building consensus. They also use these activities to help set an agenda, focus decisions, and ensure that the outcome is clearly captured. Having a record of what decisions were made, and why, is an essential part of the solution process from a program management perspective and good engineering in aggregate. Often, you’ll see leaders in other disciplines playing these roles because they recognize the value. Note taking and scheduling meetings are not skills unique to program management.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;ve seen other PdMs doing during meetings, typing in the running notes as the meeting progresses, something to focus on in the next phase.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Even in the midst of action, great program managers will step back and consider whether they (and their friends and colleagues) are really operating on a solid plan.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I definitely feel the need for this on a regular basis, as I&rsquo;m often getting swept up in the question/crisis of the day when I also need to take stock of everything that&rsquo;s going on and make sure that we&rsquo;re still working towards our objectives or if those need to change. It&rsquo;s easy to get into a rut of just dealing with the urgent requests that come in, that&rsquo;s easy; it&rsquo;s much harder to craft a plan, constantly question and work towards it.</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Great program managers are instinctive designers who crave creativity, design, and problem solving as part of their daily lives.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;m maybe not going to look at every little thing and put on my PdM voice and interrogate the thought processes that brought it into being, but I appreciate the sentiment.</p>
