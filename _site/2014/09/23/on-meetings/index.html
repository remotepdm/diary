        <h3>23 Sep 2014</h3>
<p>When I first started working with my team I noticed that, in comparison that other teams whose meetings I’d observed, we were fairly quiet and non-communicative in our scheduled dealings with each other. There was little to no banter, compared with what I saw in other teams, and there didn’t seem to be much team spirit. These meetings felt like a chore.</p>

<p>All of that changed recently when we started to have more regular SCRUM meetings. We’re still in the early stages of the process, but the early signs have been encouraging. I was particularly sceptical about the “story time” or demo meeting, as so much of our work is stuff that’s not easily demonstrable to non-technical persons like myself. I was also nervous about holding engineers to account like this. However, what I completely underestimated was the fact that engineers actually <em>want</em> to show what they’ve been working on! It’s so obvious that I’m kicking myself for not seeing it sooner. The meeting was full of energy and banter and, most importantly, we all actually learnt about what everyone else had been up to (to the extent that I wonder how much communication there actually is amongst the engineers themselves, but more on that in a later post). This brings up all kinds of questions, gets people interacting and starts a knowledge-sharing process, which is crucial in a distributed team.</p>

<p>I actually really enjoyed the demos; it’s really rewarding to see the work that we’ve been talking about for the last few weeks actually working in front of your eyes. Maybe it’ll lose its lustre, but I’m hoping it’ll become one of these chemically reinforcing brain addictions. We’re starting daily standups today, so let’s see how those go, but I’m cautiously optimistic…</p>
